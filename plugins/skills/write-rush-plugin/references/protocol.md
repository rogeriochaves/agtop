# The rush plugin protocol (version 1)

## Transport

**rush plugins** (`"protocol": "rush"`, the default): fd 3 is one end of a unix socket pair rush created for the plugin. `RUSH_IPC_FD=3` says so. Nothing else can connect to it. Every message, both ways, is:

```
[4 bytes: length N, big-endian uint32][N bytes: one JSON-RPC 2.0 message, UTF-8]
```

N is at most 16 MB; a bigger frame closes the connection. There is no newline, and nothing to escape.

**MCP plugins** (`"protocol": "mcp"`): standard MCP stdio, one JSON message per line on stdin and stdout. rush initializes the server once, with protocol version `2025-06-18` and no client capabilities, and forwards `tools/list` and `tools/call` from every session to that one process. It offers no sampling, roots or elicitation. The server's `instructions`, if any, go to each session.

JSON-RPC 2.0 throughout: a request has `id`, `method`, `params`; a reply has the same `id` and either `result` or `error: {code, message}`; a notification has no `id` and gets no reply. **Both sides send requests**, so a rush plugin must tell a reply (no `method`) from a request (`method` and `id`) from a notification (`method`, no `id`). Handle requests concurrently. Notifications arrive in order.

## Lifecycle

1. The broker checks the plugin's files against the approval, starts it (sandboxed, at utility QoS), and sends `initialize`.
2. The plugin answers within 15 seconds. It is then "running", and sessions' tool calls reach it.
3. When fd 3 closes, the plugin exits. If the plugin exits, or its fd 3 closes, or it goes over its memory limit, the broker starts it again after 1s, 2s, 4s … up to 60s, resetting once a run lasts a minute.
4. If its files change, the broker stops it and doesn't start it again until the user re-approves.

## rush → plugin

### `initialize` (request)

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{
  "protocol": 1,
  "name": "notes",
  "dataDir": "/Users/you/.config/rush/plugin-data/notes",
  "sessions": ["list"],
  "workspaces": ["/Users/you/Source"],
  "network": [],
  "exec": [],
  "ui": ["events", "overview"],
  "commands": ["summarize"],
  "settings": {"verbose": "false"}
}}
```

Answer `{}` (anything but an error). `sessions`, `workspaces`, `network`, `exec` (the names of the programs it may run), `ui` and `commands` (their names) are what the plugin was approved for; `workspaces` are resolved to real paths. `settings` is each setting's value: what the user set, or its default.

### `tools.list` (request)

Answer `{"tools": [ ... ]}`, MCP tool definitions:

```json
{"name": "note", "description": "Keep a note for later sessions.",
 "inputSchema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["text"], "additionalProperties": false}}
```

Tool names: letters, digits, `_` and `-`. Claude sees them as `mcp__rush-<plugin>__<tool>`, 64 characters at most in all.

### `tools.call` (request)

```json
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":7,"method":"tools.call","params":{
  "session": "a1b2c3d4",
  "name": "note",
  "arguments": {"text": "the build needs Go 1.27"}
}}
```

`session` is the id of the rush session whose Claude called the tool. When rush knows it, the call also carries `sessionId` (Claude Code's id for the conversation, the one its transcript and hooks use), `cwd`, and `meta` (what the session was started with, see `sessions.start`). They tell the plugin which of its things the caller is: a `my_task` tool, say, looks up the task by `meta` or `sessionId` rather than asking Claude. Answer an MCP `CallToolResult`:

```json
{"content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Noted."}], "isError": false}
```

Tool failures are `isError: true` results with a message Claude can act on. Reserve JSON-RPC errors for broken requests. A call may take up to 10 minutes. The user is asked to allow each call before it reaches the plugin.

### `session.event` (notification)

This is sent for each session the plugin follows with `sessions.subscribe`. It covers only what happens after the subscription, not history. `params.session` is the id, and `params.type` is one of:

| `type` | Other fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `info` | `state`, `detail`, `needs`, `costUsd` | Its state changed. `state` is `starting`, `working`, `blocked` (waiting for the user), `idle` or `stopped`. `detail` is what it's doing in words; `needs` is what it's blocked on. |
| `sent` | `text` | A message was sent to it (by anyone). |
| `text` | `text` | Claude said this (main thread, not subagents). |
| `tool` | `name`, `doing` | Claude used a tool; `doing` says what, in words. The tool's output is never sent. |
| `result` | `text`, `isError`, `costUsd`, `turns` | A turn ended; `text` is Claude's final answer. |
| `closed` | | The session's host went away; subscribe again once it's back if needed. |

### `ui.event` (notification) — needs `events` or `input`

Something happened in one of rush's windows. Sent without waiting for the plugin: one that falls behind loses its oldest events, and `input.changed` for the same box is sent only as its latest.

```json
{"kind": "turn.ended", "ui": "main", "at": "2026-09-28T10:00:00Z",
 "session": {"id": "a1b2c3d4", "sessionId": "5f0c…", "name": "fix the flaky test", "agent": "claude",
             "cwd": "/Users/you/Source/app", "repo": "/Users/you/Source/app", "branch": "main", "state": "idle", "hosted": true}}
```

| `kind` | Needs | Other fields |
|---|---|---|
| `session.seen` | `events` | a session rush shows: each open or at work today when the plugin connects (up to 150), then each new one |
| `session.opened` / `session.left` | `events` | its Session came into or went out of view |
| `turn.started` / `turn.ended` | `events` | |
| `session.stopped` | `events` | `error: {kind, message, retrying}` when an error did it; `kind` is `limit`, `auth`, `offline`, `retryable`, `too-long` or `other`; `retrying` is rush continuing the session itself (its own sessions, and others for a day, after `offline` or `retryable`), so a plugin needn't |
| `network.down` / `network.up` | `events` | no `session` |
| `input.changed` / `input.sent` / `input.cleared` | `input` | `text`, the message box; `input.changed` also has `box`, the whole box (below) |

`ui` names the rush window. Only `input` events carry `text`; a `session` absent from one means the Prompt's box. `input.changed` with empty `text` is a box emptied by hand (`input.sent` and `input.cleared` say so themselves). A plugin that connects while the API is unreachable hears `network.down` at once.

### `ui.command` (request)

`{"plugin": "…", "command": "summarize", "ui": "main", "session": {…}, "box": "a1b2c3d4", "input": {…}}`: the user ran one of its `commands`, on `session` if one was selected (as in `ui.event`, or absent). `box` is whose message box had the keys: a session's id, or `""` for the Prompt (where new sessions start). `input`, to a plugin with `input` only, is that box as it was when the key was pressed, whole:

`{"text": "see [Image #1] and [#2 4 lines: first…last]", "cursor": 3, "pastes": {"2": "…"}, "images": {"1": "/path/a.png"}}`

`text` is as the box shows it, with a long paste as its chip and an image as its marker; `cursor` counts characters from the start; `pastes` and `images` are what each chip and marker stand for. The Prompt's images are attachments rather than markers in its text, numbered 1, 2, 3. Answer `{}` within 10 seconds; the work may go on after.

### `ui.picked` (request)

`{"plugin": "…", "pick": "history", "item": "a1", "action": "enter", "ui": "main", "box": "…", "input": {…}}`: the user chose `item` from the plugin's pick `pick` (see `ui.pick`) with the action on key `action`. `box` and `input` are as in `ui.command`. Answer `{}` within 10 seconds.

### `ui.intercept` (request) — needs `intercept`

`{"hook": "before-send", "ui": "main", "session": {…}, "text": "…"}`: a message is about to go. Answer one of:

```json
{"action": "allow"}
{"action": "rewrite", "text": "the message, changed"}
{"action": "block", "reason": "shown to the user"}
```

Plugins are asked in name order, each seeing the text as the ones before left it; a `block` stops it. Each has 250 ms, and all together 400 ms. No answer in time, or an error, counts as `allow`; three in a row and the plugin isn't asked again until it restarts.

### `ui.settings` (notification)

`{"values": {"verbose": "true"}}`: the user changed a setting; these are all its values now.

### `cli.run` (request)

`{"command": "send", "args": ["a1b2c3d4", "0"], "cwd": "/Users/you/src/app"}`: the user ran `rush <plugin> send a1b2c3d4 0`, one of its `cli` commands. `cwd` is the folder they ran it in, to go by, not to read. Answer `{"stdout": "…", "stderr": "…", "exit": 0}` within 2 minutes: rush prints `stdout` and `stderr` (a megabyte of each at most) and exits with `exit`. What the command does, it does as the plugin, with what its manifest allows.

## plugin → rush

Each call is checked against the approved manifest. A refused call gets error **`-32001`** with a message saying why. Session ids are short strings like `a1b2c3d4`.

### `sessions.list` — needs `list`

No params. Returns every rush-mode session:

```json
[{"id": "a1b2c3d4", "sessionId": "5f0c…-…", "name": "fix the flaky test",
  "cwd": "/Users/you/Source/app/.claude/worktrees/flaky", "repo": "/Users/you/Source/app/.claude/worktrees/flaky",
  "branch": "fix-flaky", "worktree": true,
  "state": "working", "detail": "running go test ./...", "needs": "", "model": "claude-opus-5-5",
  "permissionMode": "acceptEdits", "costUsd": 0.42, "contextTokens": 81234, "queued": 1,
  "startedBy": "kanban", "meta": {"card": "card_2x…"}, "startedAt": "…", "updatedAt": "…"}]
```

- `sessionId` is Claude Code's id for the conversation, empty until it has started. Other tools (Claude Code's hooks, transcripts in `~/.claude/projects`, anything that reads them) know the session by it.
- `repo` is the top of the git checkout `cwd` is in, `branch` what it has checked out (the first 8 characters of a commit when detached), and `worktree` is true for a linked worktree.
- `contextTokens` is how much context the last request sent, the conversation's size as the model sees it. `queued` is how many messages wait for its turn to end.
- `startedBy` is the plugin that started it, or empty; `meta` is what that plugin tagged it with.

What was said is never included.

### `sessions.watch` / `sessions.unwatch` — needs `list`

`sessions.watch` takes no params and returns the list, as `sessions.list` does. From then on, rush checks every 2 seconds and sends:

| Notification | `params` | When |
|---|---|---|
| `session.changed` | a session, as in the list | one appeared, or anything about it changed |
| `session.gone` | `{"id": "…"}` | its host's files were removed (a stopped session stays, as `"state": "stopped"`) |

Call it once `initialize` has been answered (before then it fails; ask again). Watching again replaces the old watch. `sessions.unwatch` ends it. It also ends when the plugin restarts.

### `sessions.start` — needs `start`

```json
{"cwd": "/Users/you/Source/app", "prompt": "Update the changelog for 2.3",
 "name": "changelog", "model": "sonnet", "effort": "medium", "permissionMode": "acceptEdits"}
```

Two more fields, both optional:

- `worktree: {"name": "…", "branch": "…", "base": "…"}` runs the session in a new git worktree of the checkout `cwd` is in, at `<checkout>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`, where Claude Code puts its own. `branch` is the new branch (`worktree-<name>` if left out) and `base` what it starts from (`HEAD` if left out). `name` defaults to one made from the branch or the session's name. The checkout must be inside the plugin's workspaces too.
- `meta: {"card": "card_2x…"}` tags the session, and comes back in `sessions.list`, `session.changed` and every `tools.call` from it. At most 16 keys, of letters, digits and `_ . -`, with values of at most 1 KB.

Only `cwd` and `prompt` are required. It returns `{"id": "…", "cwd": "…"}`, `cwd` being where the session runs (the worktree's folder, if it made one). What rush enforces:

- `cwd` must be absolute, exist, and be inside one of the plugin's `workspaces`.
- `permissionMode` must be `default` (the default), `acceptEdits` or `plan`.
- `effort` must be `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh` or `max`.
- The prompt is at most 100 KB.
- The session is named `<plugin>: <name>`, runs on the user's account and defaults, and is marked as the plugin's.
- A plugin can have at most 4 sessions running at once, and start at most 30 an hour.

### `sessions.send` — needs `send`, own sessions only

`{"id": "…", "text": "…", "now": false}`. When the agent is busy, the message queues and goes when its turn ends; `now: true` delivers it mid-turn instead. Text is at most 100 KB. Returns `{}`.

### `sessions.queue` — needs `queue`

`{"id": "…", "text": "…"}`. Queues a message to **any** session in the plugin's workspaces, not only its own, as a queued message of yours would be: it goes when the turn ends, or now if the session is idle. Returns `{}`. What rush enforces:

- The session runs in one of the plugin's workspaces (a session it started always may).
- Its permission mode asks the user first: `default`, `acceptEdits` or `plan`. A session in `bypassPermissions` or `auto` is refused.
- The text is at most 100 KB, and goes with a first line saying who it's from, `[from the rush plugin <name>]`, so neither Claude nor the user takes it for the user's.

### `sessions.queued.send` / `sessions.queued.remove` — needs `queued`

`{"id": "…", "index": 0, "was": "…"}`. Sends now, or drops, the message waiting at `index` (from 0) in the queue of any session in the plugin's workspaces (a session it started always may), and returns `{}` once the session says it's gone. The plugin never sees queued text: `sessions.list` gives only how many are `queued`. `was` is for rush's own bundled plugins only (naming a message by its text would let a plugin test guesses at what's queued): from any other plugin it's refused. Without it the message at `index` now is the one meant.

### `sessions.subscribe` / `sessions.unsubscribe` — needs `read`, own sessions only

`{"id": "…"}`. Returns `{}`; events follow as `session.event`. Subscribing again replaces the old subscription. Subscriptions end when the plugin restarts.

### `sessions.interrupt` / `sessions.stop` — needs `control`, own sessions only

`{"id": "…"}`. Interrupt stops the current turn; stop ends the session (its conversation is kept, and the user can resume it). Returns `{}`.

### `exec` — needs the program in `exec`

```json
{"name": "kanban", "args": ["show", "card_2x…"], "stdin": "", "cwd": "/Users/you/Source/app"}
```

Runs a program the manifest names in `exec`, **outside the sandbox, as the user**: its fixed command line, then `args`. `cwd` must be inside the plugin's workspaces; without it, the program runs in the plugin's data folder. It gets the user's environment. It returns when the program exits:

```json
{"code": 0, "stdout": "…", "stderr": "", "truncated": false}
```

A non-zero exit is a result, not an error. Limits: 64 arguments of at most 4 KB, 1 MB of stdin, the first 1 MB of each of stdout and stderr (`truncated` says if more was cut), a minute to run, and 4 programs at once.

### `sidebar.set` — needs `sidebar`

Arranges rush's agent list: the plugin's own sections, in its order, and a name and place for each agent it knows, by Claude Code session id (`sessionId` in `sessions.list`).

```json
{"title": "Kanban",
 "sections": [{"title": "In Progress"}, {"title": "Waiting"}],
 "agents": {"8c76706f-1c00-4aed-9c6d-7509f3033943": {"name": "Fix login bug", "section": "In Progress", "order": 0}}}
```

The list offers it as a group-by mode, `plugin:<name>`, labelled with `title`. In that mode the plugin's sections replace rush's, agents sort by `order` inside each, and each shows `name` unless the user renamed it in rush. Agents it doesn't place go to a folded section, Other. Each call replaces the last; empty params or no `sections` clear it. Returns `{}`. What rush enforces:

- At most 32 sections and 2000 agents; titles at most 64 characters, names 200. Section titles are unique.
- Every id matches `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`, and every agent's `section` is one of `sections`.
- Escape sequences and control characters are removed from every string, and line breaks become spaces.

rush keeps it in `~/.config/rush/plugin-sidebar/<name>.json`, outside the plugin's reach, and removes it when the plugin is revoked. It only labels agents rush shows anyway: it grants the plugin nothing.

### `ui.overview.set` — needs `ui` `overview`

```json
{"session": "a1b2c3d4", "sections": [
  {"id": "ci", "title": "CI", "lines": [{"text": "3 checks failing", "tone": "bad", "url": "https://github.com/…"}]}]}
```

Replaces the plugin's sections in that session's overview; `[]` removes them. `session` is the `id` from `ui.event`. At most 4 sections, ids as `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$` and unique, titles 60 characters, 24 lines of 200. `tone` is `dim`, `good`, `warn`, `bad`, `accent` or empty; `url` only `http(s)`, opened with enter. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.status.set` — needs `ui` `overview`

`{"session": "…", "text": "CI red", "tone": "bad"}`: a short status on the session's row, at most 24 characters; empty `text` removes it. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.notify` — needs `ui` `notify`

`{"ui": "main", "session": "…", "text": "…", "tone": "warn"}`: a message at the bottom of the screen, at most 200 characters, after the plugin's name and, with `session`, that session's; without `ui`, in every window. Three at once, then one a second. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.input.set` — needs `ui` `input`

`{"ui": "main", "session": "…", "text": "…"}`: sets that message box, at most 100 KB: the session's, or with `session` `""` the Prompt's. The window sets it only while that box is on its screen (a session's Session open, or the Prompt taking a new session), else it's dropped. Returns `{}`.

With `"box": {…}` instead of `text`, it sets the whole box as `ui.command` shows one: chips, images (absolute paths) and cursor, at most 64 of each. With `"if": "…"`, the window sets it only while the box's `text` is exactly that, so nothing typed since the plugin looked is lost; `"if": ""` sets only an empty box. The set is one undo away.

### `ui.box.note` — needs `ui` `input`

`{"session": "…", "text": "stashed · ctrl+p brings it back", "tone": "dim"}`: a short note, at most 60 characters, on the bottom edge of that session's message box, or with `session` `""` the Prompt's; the tones are as for `ui.status.set`. Empty `text` takes it off. It goes when the plugin stops. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.pick`

`{"ui": "main", "pick": {"id": "history", "title": "Drafts", "about": "…", "tabs": ["Sent", "Cleared"], "tab": 0, "items": [{"id": "a1", "tab": 0, "text": "first line is the row\nthe next two a preview", "meta": "2m ago"}], "actions": [{"key": "enter", "name": "put it back"}, {"key": "ctrl+d", "name": "forget it", "stay": true}], "empty": ["nothing sent yet", "nothing cleared"], "session": "…"}}`: shows that window a list to choose from, filtered as the user types, in tabs `[` and `]` go through. Each action is a key, `enter` or `ctrl+`/`alt+` with a letter or digit, and sends `ui.picked`; one that `stay`s keeps the list open without the item. `session` is whose message box it's about (`""` the Prompt). It's shown only in answer to the user: within 10 seconds of a `ui.command` or `ui.picked` for the plugin in that window, else refused. At most 500 items, 6 tabs and 6 actions. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.send` — needs `ui` `send`

`{"session": "…", "text": "…"}`: the window sends it as if the user had typed it and pressed enter, or continues a session an error stopped. The session must have come in a `ui.event`, with its `cwd` in the plugin's workspaces, and ask before acting (not `bypassPermissions` or `auto`). Text is 1 byte to 100 KB; ten a minute. Returns `{}`.

### `ui.settings.get`

No params. Returns `{"values": {…}}`, as in `initialize`.

Everything a plugin adds to the screen is cleaned of escapes and control characters, and goes when it stops or restarts.

### `log`

`{"message": "…"}`. This writes a line (at most 1 KB) to the broker's log. It works as a request or a notification. Plain stderr works too, and goes to the plugin's own log.

## Error codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| -32700 | parse error |
| -32601 | method not found |
| -32602 | bad params (bad id, cwd doesn't exist, text too long …) |
| -32000 | something failed (the session isn't running …) |
| -32001 | not permitted: the capability (or `sidebar`, or the `ui` one) wasn't approved, the session isn't the plugin's, the cwd is outside its workspaces, the program isn't in `exec`, a limit was hit |
| -32002 | too often: `ui.notify` or `ui.send` past its rate; the same call may go later |
