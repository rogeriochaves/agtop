// interface a Conn has only when its agent can, found with a type
// assertion. The host offers an op only to a session whose Conn has it.

// own drawing tools, or an approved plugin's.

	// MCP servers so: rush's own executable with these.

// Responder is a Conn that takes an approval's answer with more than an
// option: the call's input as you changed it, in the agent's own words,
// and a refusal's message, and whether a refusal stops the turn.

// turn and the rest running.

// left: it should rest once its turn ends, and pick up on the new one.
