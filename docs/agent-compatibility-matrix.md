# Rush compatibility matrix — 2026-10-01

Current working-tree snapshot, including uncommitted adapter changes. This documents Rush integration, not everything each native CLI or model can do. Extracted from all 21 registered adapters and 38 feature definitions. No authenticated inference or destructive session operations were performed for this review.

✓ = adapter declares support; ✓* = qualified support (notes below); — = not exposed by Rush; P = planned, not implemented. A tick is not a new live test. Model abilities, accounts and runtime protocol negotiation can further restrict availability.

Levels are the repository’s own labels: full / tested / preview. They describe integration maturity, not a guarantee for every feature or model.

## Harness and provider pairings

Pi and OpenCode can expose providers configured in their native tools; those dynamic catalogs are not an assertion that Rush has a dedicated account/usage integration for every provider. Anthropic/OpenAI cross-harness Pi routes use API keys, not transferable native subscriptions. Ollama pairings require a compatible tool-capable local model. Image support also depends on the model.

## Important qualifications

- **Codex compaction:** `/compact` and #compact call native `thread/compact/start` (Codex and Ollama-in-Codex). Conversation rollback (`thread/rollback`) is deprecated and is not file restoration. These are integration gaps/distinctions, not evidence that Codex cannot compress. [Official app-server documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server).
- **External compression:** only Claude and Ollama currently implement the summarizer interface. Codex is not an available summarizing engine. The target session must advertise rewind, have a protocol-9-or-newer host, and pass unchanged-session/idle/queue guards. Most harnesses are therefore excluded. Native compaction is a separate path. Ollama classifiers such as tev1 are excluded as summarizers.
- **Inherited rewind declarations corrected:** `deepseek-claude` and `glm-claude` do not implement `agent.Rewinder` or `agent.Brancher`; their rewind flags are now disabled. A registry regression test requires both interfaces for every advertised rewind feature. Their other inherited ticks remain declarations, not verified end-to-end coverage; provider-specific image/tool behavior needs checking.
- **ACP harnesses:** Kimi, Vibe, Copilot, OpenCode, dsh and ZCode use protocol negotiation. Resume depends on advertised load/resume support; images depend on advertised image input and model ability; model/permission/plan choices depend on what the running CLI returns. A static yes is not a guarantee that a particular installation offers the control.
- **Antigravity:** preview, text-only streaming input in the current adapter. Model selected before startup; effort/permission/plan settings are startup selections. History covers Rush-started conversations, not native imports. No Rush quota display or interactive question/approval protocol. Signed-in model execution remains unverified in the preceding implementation pass.
- **Pi:** fork means the whole conversation, not rewind to a selected message. Context is occupancy, not a composition breakdown. Questions are extension select/confirm. Rush does not expose Pi permission modes; its adapter notes that tools run without asking. Extension features are not automatically Rush features.
- **Kimi:** native login, configured model discovery, local history, and Kimi Code plan quota are integrated. Its native `/compact` is exposed. No Rush account swapping, rewind, or mid-turn steering is declared. Its saved wire history reader and account handling are specific to Kimi; its conversation UI is shared.
- **Vibe:** native login and saved local history are integrated. No Rush account switching or remaining-quota display; effort depends on the model. Ollama-in-Vibe is a separate adapter with a different feature set.
- **Usage semantics differ:** Claude/Codex quota windows, Copilot premium requests, DeepSeek API balance, GLM Coding Plan and Kimi Code plan limits are distinct measures. Local Ollama pricing means no provider token charge, not zero machine/energy cost.
- **Shared Rush features:** composer, queue persistence, transcript row controls, agent-message rows and community/discussion views are core UI features. The adapter’s “Subagents” flag refers to native subagent integration, not whether Rush can launch a separate peer session.

## Kimi screenshot

The blue “agent message” row is rendered by `internal/convo/exchange.go` for all harnesses. It now puts the harness first and reserves width for both sender and receiver, truncating long names by terminal-cell width. Session IDs stay in the full copied attribution rather than crowding the heading. This shared change applies to every harness. The screenshot shows the earlier requested message delivered to the Ollama Context Compression System.

## Evidence and verification

- Registry: `cmd/rush/adapters.go`, `internal/agent/feature.go`, `internal/agent/harness.go` and each registered adapter’s `Features()` / `Level()`.
- Runtime caveats: `internal/adapters/acp/session.go`, `internal/adapters/antigravity/antigravity.go`.
- Compression/rewind: `internal/ui/compactsheet.go`, `internal/ui/rewindsheet.go`, `internal/adapters/cross/cross.go`, `internal/adapters/claude/summary.go`, `internal/adapters/ollama/summary.go`.
- `TMPDIR=/tmp go test ./internal/adapters -run 'TestFeaturesMatchInterfaces|TestFeaturesKnown|TestLevels' -count=1` passed. This checks declared interface coverage and levels, not live provider behavior; the added `TestRewindRequiresWorkingInterfaces` also prevents unsupported rewind declarations.
- CSV includes every adapter/feature cell and its exact declared note, with audit-status and limitation notes.
